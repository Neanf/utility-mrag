The helpfulness templates ask the surrogate model to judge whether a candidate
image is useful for answering the query, with a binary True/False output space.
The True-token logit (or its softmax normalisation) is used as the helpfulness
score. The relevance variants ask a softer relevance question, used for
ablations.
